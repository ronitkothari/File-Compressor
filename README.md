<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A project made to learn and implement the Huffman Algorithm and lossless compression.

Allowed for greater understanding of binary trees and their traversal via recursion.

### Skills Developed

- Understanding of binary tree traversals
  - Post-Order
  - Pre-Order
- Usage of the huffman algorithm
- Compression and decompression of bits through lossless compression
